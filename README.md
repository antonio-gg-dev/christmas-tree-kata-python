# Christmas Tree Kata Python

There is a shortage of Christmas trees this year, however, you can help! In the absence of real trees, Santa is going to
teach the children of the world the magic of the console.

Unfortunately, being approximately 1,751 years old, Santa can only write binary, and needs your help to write a program
in a more modern language.

## Instructions

### Input

Given the children of the world have varying screen sizes, Santa has tasked you with printing a Christmas tree to the
console for a given argument of the treeâ€™s height to accommodate for all the children.

### Output

For example a tree with a height of 2 looks like this:

```text
 X
XXX
 |
```

And a tree with a height of 3 looks like this:

```text
  X
 XXX
XXXXX
  |
```

And a tree of height 10:

```text
         X
        XXX
       XXXXX
      XXXXXXX
     XXXXXXXXX
    XXXXXXXXXXX
   XXXXXXXXXXXXX
  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
         |
```
